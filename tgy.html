		taste that seems to linger forever,

		popular loose leaf tea from China in the
		1990s and 2000s. It is one of Chinaâ€™s
		most beloved oolongs and is extremely
		time-consuming to produce. For many
		Western tea lovers, Tie Guan Yin remains
		the introduction to Chinese Wu Long tea
		(Oolong tea) and its variation is the most
		widely seen form of Wu Long (Oolong)
		worldwide.

		(Oolong) academically referred to as Min
		Nan Wu Long, referencing its origin in the
		southern Fu Jian Province. Tie Guan Yin is
		actually the name of the varietal that made
		this style of Wu Long (Oolong) famous.
